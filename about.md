## About Me

I’m a bioinformatics PhD with 12+ years of experience in healthcare IT. My focus is on using real-world data (RWD) to create actionable, patient-centric insights that drive value in pharma.

I’ve led projects on unmet need analysis, patient segmentation, and omnichannel RWE dashboards.
